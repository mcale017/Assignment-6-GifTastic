# Assignment-6-GifTastic

I. GifTastic
------------
1. At the top of the page will be buttons that can be clicked on to display 10 gifs related to the topic of that button.
2. These buttons are created when an input is given to the form on the right side.
3. Each thumbnail will display the gif, title of the gif, rate of the gif, and the date that the gif was added to giphy.

II. Thoughts
------------
1. I couldn't get the input text box to clear up once I clicked on the submit button to dynamically create a sport button. I don't know.. I tried but yeah, I'll look into it more.
2. It was also a bit of pain in the butt to try to get columns to not stack on top of one another when the first thumbnail of that row has taller height than the next 2 or however many thumbnails combined.
3. This was sort of a nice homework to do because it pretty much combined the two class activities together and yeah, I mean it was easy but it also helped me get even more familiar with how each concept works in general.
